Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Set up renpy, decided on a story idea, and gathered assets to fit said story

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I haven't put everything together in code, like setting up the backgrounds with each scene or assigned names and sprites to the characters. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Aside from not having much time, alot of the sprites I've found don't really fit the aesthetic I was going for, and I ended up having to settle.
