# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

"What you tryna do?" (working title)

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A VN that tells a story with an optional RPG style fight. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will create a VN using RenPy that will have dialouge options, and through those options a potenial fight may occur. This fight will be in a RPG format somewhat like the origional Pokemon games (probably with less/no status effects). 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I tell a funny story with cute visuals. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can create an interactive short story containning an optional fight in the style of an RPG. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to have multiple outcomes in the interactive story and have multiple battles with varying levels of seriousness. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to learn how to create in RenPy. I will also need to find and choose sprites and other artwork that fits the kind of story I'm going for. The most challenging thing potentially will be the RPG combat. I got to learn how to code a working model and properly implemet it between dialouge trees. I have to also decide how extensive I want it to be.
